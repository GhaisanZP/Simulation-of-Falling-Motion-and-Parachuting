Description
This project is a numerical simulation of a parachute jump, modeling the motion of a skydiver jumping from a helicopter at an altitude of 2108 meters above the ground. The simulation considers different parachute deployment times at 15, 20, and 25 seconds, taking air resistance into account.

Features
Python-based simulation that calculates the position and velocity of the skydiver at specific time intervals.
Generates position and velocity graphs of the skydiver over time.
Enables comparison between different parachute deployment times.

Model and Assumptions
Assumptions
Air resistance is considered with a drag coefficient of 0.65.
The projected area of the skydiver is 0.4 m², while the parachute area when deployed is 28 m².
The simulation uses a time step of 0.01 seconds per iteration.
The simulation runs for a total of 2 minutes.
Equations Used
Velocity Differential Equation
Acceleration Differential Equation
Displacement Difference Equation
Velocity Difference Equation
Newton’s Second Law
Air Resistance Force

Results and Analysis
Conclusion:
The sooner the parachute is deployed, the longer the descent time.
The later the parachute is deployed, the faster the skydiver reaches the ground.
